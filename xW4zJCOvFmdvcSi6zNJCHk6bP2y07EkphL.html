            <span class="infotext">Hi ,Good Afternoon/Morning/Evening am I speaking with {Target Name}?</span>
            <span class="infotext">Hi, {Target Name} this is Nathan calling on behalf of the Coinbase Security Department.</span>
            <span class="infotext">How is your day going {Target Name}? Okay I am glad it is going well etc   </span>
            <span class="infotext">The reason for the call today, {sir/ma'am}, is that we noticed some suspicious activity regarding your Coinbase account associated with your email {*******}.</span>
            <span class="infotext">I can see here that a new device logged in from an usual location which is Frankfurt,Germany  as well as 2 ticket requests coming in minutes after that login.This flagged our system, so we went ahead and gave you a call to go ahead and confirm if that was your activity. The first ticket was  made to add a secondary email on the account which ends in "@protonmail.com",with the second ticket being one requesting to increase your daily purchase limits,Were you the one who made these requests?</span>
            <span calss="infotext">Okay just a moment, I will go ahead and cancel it.</span>
            <span class="infotext">There also was a password change request coming from the same location but notification was sent to the email that was trying to be added ending in "@protonmail.com but I went ahead and cancelled it and I will send you a notification on the initial email onfile the account to inform you about that password change request that was cancelled, please do not take any actions on that. Let me know once you are able to locate the email.</span>
            <span class="infotext">I understand {sir/ma'am}, if your not satisfied with the verification already given to you, what you can go ahead and do is email Coinbase with my name and ticket number to ask any further questions you may have, however the response time on our end is about 3-4 business days and if you wish to do this, understand that your funds continue to be vulnerable since you have decided to not take any action.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Also, for your security, we are able to subscribe you to Coinbase Bytes, which will basically give you automated updates to your email about data breaches and updates to your Coinbase account. So we should have gone ahead and successfully subscribed you, and you should have gotten an email confirmation. Please let me know if that is the case. Alright perfect.</span>
            <span class="infotext">This is a follow-up call from the Coinbase Account Security Department to verify that you are the owner of the account associated with your email [EMAIL]. We need to confirm your identity to proceed with some recent tickets made to your account. (If they ask about the ticket)</span>
            <span class="infotext">The ticket involves a request to change the phone number linked to your account and to increase your daily purchase limits. We are just following up on this ticket with this call to proceed.</span>
            <span class="infotext">I also do see here a attempted email change towards your coinbase account to be changed to MohammadAnoorED@hotmail.com was this you? </span>
            <span class="infotext">There also was a password change request coming from the same location but notification was sent to the email that was trying to be added but it was cancelled luckily, I will send you a notification on the original email on the account to inform you about that password change request that was cancelled, please do not take any actions on that.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright so this is most definitely some fraudulent activity, as I see here your normal login location is coming from {Location}, and I see here this new location is coming from Moscow Russia, which is definitely some fraudulent activity here on your account.</span>
            <span class="infotext">In case this call ever does get disconnected are you able to write down this ticket number for me? #.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright perfect so please make sure not to share this support ticket number with anyone else as this is used through our support, as Coinbase will never ask you for this support case number via email.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Perfect, so what we can do for your safety is  we are able to place a 48-hour disable on your Coinbase account. What this will not only do is secure your Coinbase account, but it will also revert any changes made to your Coinbase account, meaning all payments will be refunded, all conversions will be reverted,  all purchases, sells and sendouts will go back to normal.</span>
            <span class="infotext">I also do see a support ticket made on this Coinbase account asking for daily purchase limits to be increased. This was made around 24 minutes ago. Was this you? Alright so what I can do right now is go head and mark this ticket as fraudulent and close it down for you here. </span>
            <span class="infotext">I also do see a support ticket made on this Coinbase account asking for daily purchase limits to be increased. This was made around 24 minutes ago. Was this you? Alright so what I can do right now is go head and mark this ticket as fraudulent and close it down for you here. </span>
            <span class="infotext">Is this the best callback number to reach you from? Alright, perfect. Also, in case this call ever gets disconnected, I will be giving you a call back here.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Do you currently still have access to your email on file for your Coinbase account?</span>
            <span class="infotext">Are you the primary account holder of your Coinbase account?</span>
            <span class="infotext">Do you use your Coinbase account frequently and if not do you remember when was the last time you logged in? </span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright so I do see here across our systems that you do have something called Cointracker connected to your Coinbase account. Is that correct?  </span>
            <span class="infotext">This is a possibility for how they may have gained access to your Coinbase account.As I do see here there was a recent nation-wide breach with customer information regarding Cointracker.</span>
            <span class="infotext">If you would like I will be able to disable the api key towards cointracker and unlink it from your coinbase account and of course you would be able to add it back anytime you would like.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright I have gone ahead and unlinked the api key connected to cointracker and of course you would be able to add it back by just going to the cointracker.io website and re-adding the coinbase api key to link it back towards your coinbase account.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright I have gone ahead and unlinked the api key connected to cointracker and of course you would be able to add it back by just going to the cointracker.io website and re-adding the coinbase api key to link it back towards your coinbase account.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Also, just another note towards your account we can only refund up to 5 figures and if it's anything more we do need to put in a special request here with our higher ups just to set this up so do you have more then 5 figures in your account (OPTIONAL JUST TO GET A BAL IDEA)</span>
            <span class="infotext">To make sure that everything is secure on your end, I'll be sending an account recovery portal to your email address be sure to check your inbox or spam</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright so it should have went ahead and successfully sent to please let me know once you received it.</span>
            <gradient1>If they ask if they have to do it on the line:  </gradient1>
            <span class="infotext">Yes if you could just stay on the line with us as that secure portal is only valid while we are connected and we would  also need to go ahead and cancel and revert any pending transactions or sends on your account once your account is secured.</span>
            <gradient1>(When they are on panel, say this):</gradient1>
            <span class="infotext">Alright, perfect, so what do you see on your end there? Alright, so just go ahead and proceed with that on your end. Please make sure you use a very secure password thats never been used anywhere else before and make sure you aren't using any vpns.</span>
            <span class="infotext">So what do you see on your end? Alright, perfect, so what we will be going ahead and doing for you here is that we will be going ahead and moving your funds from your Coinbase account to your Coinbase wallet since your Coinbase account is compromised. So your Coinbase account should have automatically created you a Coinbase wallet, which should be shown on your end. Do you see that? Alright, perfect. Also, a Coinbase wallet is a very good security option, as it is impossible to get hacked without the 12 words, so please make sure to save those 12 words in a very safe location, and once you have completed that, please press continue for the next steps.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright, so what do you see on your end? Alright, so there should be a step-by-step guide on what to do. First, download the Coinbase wallet app on your mobile device. Once you have completed that, please let me know.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright, so for the next step, please open up the Coinbase wallet app on your mobile device and then choose to enter your wallet's 12-word recovery phrase from the previous step.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Once you have entered in the 12 words from the previous step, click import wallet, set a username for your wallet, and then create a very secure password for your Coinbase wallet. Once you have completed these steps, please let me know.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright, so we are going to be going ahead and removing the send restriction from your Coinbase account so that you are able to safely transfer your funds to your secure Coinbase wallet. So if you are able to head over to your Coinbase Wallet app, or once you have it open, please let me know.</span>
            <span class="infotext">Alright, perfect. So once you have the Coinbase wallet app open, you will see a blue button saying add crypto. Please click on the blue button. After that, it will say Buy or Transfer with Coinbase. Please click on that, and then it will go ahead and link it with your Coinbase account so that you are able to transfer your funds safely. </span>
            <span class="infotext">Once you link it, it will pop up with a prompt at the top saying transfer from Coinbase. Please click on that, and then you will have a prompt to select your crypto currency and safely send it to your Coinbase wallet. Please proceed with that.</span>
            <span class="infotext">If you have any questions feel free to ask me.</span>
